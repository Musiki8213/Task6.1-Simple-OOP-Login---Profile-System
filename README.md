# Task 6.1 — Simple OOP Login & Profile System

This project is a web-based login and profile system built with JavaScript (OOP), SQLite3, and DOM manipulation. Users can sign up, sign in, view their profile, and sign out. The `UserAuth` class handles all user authentication methods, and the SQLite3 database stores user data securely.

## Files
- `signup.html` — Sign-up page  
- `index.html` — Login page  
- `profile.html` — Profile page  
- `main.js` — JavaScript class and DOM logic  
- SQLite3 database file — Stores user information  

## Features
- Sign up with username, email, and password  
- Login with credentials and track logged-in status  
- Profile displays username, email, creation date, and logged-in status  
- OOP structure using a `UserAuth` class with methods: signup, login, logout, getProfile  
- Redirects users if not logged in  

## Setup
1. Open the HTML files in a web browser.  
2. Ensure the SQLite3 database file is in the correct directory.  
3. Test using the provided credentials or create a new account via the sign-up page.
